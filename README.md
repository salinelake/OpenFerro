# OpenFerro
JAX-based framework for Lattice Hamiltonian simulation


## Units
OpenFerro do not process unit conversion. The internal unit system is the same as the 'metal' unit system used in LAMMPS.

mass = grams/mole

distance = Angstroms

time = picoseconds

energy = eV

velocity = Angstroms/picosecond

force = eV/Angstrom

torque = eV

temperature = Kelvin

pressure = bars

dynamic viscosity = Poise

charge = multiple of electron charge (1.0 is a proton)

dipole = charge*Angstroms

electric field = volts/Angstrom

density = gram/cm^dim
