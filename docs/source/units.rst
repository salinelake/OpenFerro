Units
=====


The internal units of OpenFerro are:

* mass = eV/(Angstroms/picoseconds)^2

* distance = Angstroms

* time = picoseconds

* energy = eV

* velocity = Angstroms/picosecond

* force = eV/Angstrom

* temperature = Kelvin

* pressure = eV/Angstrom^3

* charge = multiple of electron charge (1.0 is a proton)

* dipole = charge*Angstroms

* electric field = volts/Angstrom

* Magnetic dipole moment = Bohr magneton

* Magnetic field = eV / Bohr magneton

A few constants are defined in the `openferro.units` module:

* Boltzmann constant:  8.6173303e-5  [eV/K]

* Vacuum permittivity:  5.526349406e-3  [:math:`e^2(\text{eV*\AA})^{-1}`]

* Elementary charge: 1.0 [electron charge]

* Atomic mass unit: 0.0001035 [:math:`\text{eV (A/ps)^{-2}}`]

* Electron g-factor: 2.00231930436
