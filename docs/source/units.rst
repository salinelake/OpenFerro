Units
=====


OpenFerro uses the 'metal' unit system (same as LAMMPS):

* mass = grams/mole

* distance = Angstroms

* time = picoseconds

* energy = eV

* velocity = Angstroms/picosecond

* force = eV/Angstrom

* torque = eV

* temperature = Kelvin

* pressure = bars

* dynamic viscosity = Poise

* charge = multiple of electron charge (1.0 is a proton)

* dipole = charge*Angstroms

* electric field = volts/Angstrom

* density = gram/cm^dim

* Magnetic dipole moment = Bohr magneton

* Magnetic field = eV / Bohr magneton
